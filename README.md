I forked and made a script to implement what's talked about in the video.  Feel free to improve.

How to Use This Script in Termux:

1. Open Termux.


2. Create a new file called run_llama.sh:

nano run_llama.sh


3. Paste the above script into the file, then save and exit (in nano, press CTRL+O then Enter, followed by CTRL+X).


4. Make the script executable:

chmod +x run_llama.sh


5. Run the script:

./run_llama.sh
